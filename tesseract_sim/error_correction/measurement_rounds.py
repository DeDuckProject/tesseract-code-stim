    We implement the following: (cited from the paper):
    "Of course, transversal X and Z measurements, followed by classical decoding, can be used to destructively measure all of the logical X or Z operators fault tolerantly.
    Interestingly, there is also a simple procedure for measuring half the logical qubits in the X basis and half in the Z basis.
    For example, to measure Z, X, Z, X, Z, X, apply row-transversal CNOT gates from row 1 to row 4, and row 2 to row 3;
    then measure each qubit in the top half in the X basis, and each in the bottom in the Z basis.
    As shown in Fig. 5(b), the CNOT gates divide the logical qubits between two [[8, 3, 2]] color codes.
    Although these codes only have distance two, they have distance four in the direction that matters (Z distance four for the top half, X distance four for the bottom), so one can reliably decode the measurement results.
    We will use this measurement procedure in the repeated error correction experiments below."
